    "You cannot use the engine itself in your evaluation function, but you may find it helpful as you figure out what could make for good features in your evaluation function. Also recommended are the chess position analysis tools available online, such as `https://lichess.org/analysis/standard` to help you get some intuition about what sort of actions may be desirable. What kind of factors would you imagine go into scoring a chess board position? Try to implement some of those in your `get_position_score` function. \n",
